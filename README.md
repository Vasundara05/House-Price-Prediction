# House Price Prediction

## Introduction
This project predicts house prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

## Files
-  HousePricePrediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
-  Housing.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher   
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- You can install the required packages using the following command:
  1. pip install scikit-learn seaborn pandas matplotlib

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone https://github.com/Vasundara05/House-Price-Prediction.git
   - cd house_price_prediction
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook from the project directory
   - jupyter notebook
   - Open HousePricePrediction.ipynb in your Jupyter Notebook interface.
3. Run the Notebook:
   - Run all the cells in the notebook to see the complete process of:
   - 1.Loading and preprocessing the dataset Housing.csv.
   - 2.Building and training the Linear Regression model.
   - 3.Evaluating the model's performance.
   - 4.Making predictions on new data.
4. Test the Model with Your Own Data
   - To test the model with your own data, follow these steps:
   - 1.Ensure your data is in proper format.
   - 2.Modify the code in the last section of the notebook to predict the price.

## Results
The model predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy. Further details and results can be viewed in the Jupyter notebook.
